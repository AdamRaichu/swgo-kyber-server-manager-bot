# SWGO Kyber Server Manager Bot

This is a purpose-built Discord bot for managing the SWGO Kyber server. It allows users to start, stop, and monitor the server through Discord commands.

This bot is intended to be used with the lua component of my [KyberDiscordBridgePlugin](https://github.com/AdamRaichu/KyberDiscordBridgePlugin).
